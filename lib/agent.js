/**

Protocols
---------

We now describe the protocol that the parties use to construct the transactions
shown above.

### Local initialization (asyncInitialize)

**1. Local initialization .** Both agents initialize the following
- their local addresses (source, destination)
- a htlc and revocation secret to be used in the first payment
- the shared multisig object is initialized, but the address has not been
  generated yet.

### Opening the channel (asyncOpenChannel)

As there are inherent malleability problems if two parties fund a payment
channel. To avoid this problem we use a version where only Alice funds the
channel.

**1. Alice and Bob exchange their public projections (initializeOther).** This
allows them to build a shared multisig address and to know the public versions
of the other agents htlc and revocation secret. After this step the following
is initialized

**2. Alice and Bob build the shared multisig (asyncInitializeMultisig).** Now
that they have exchanged public keys for the multisig address, they can both
build it.

**3. The funder (Alice) builds a funding transaction.** The agent that funds
the channel creates the funding transaction that spends to the shared multisig
address. She does not broadcast it yet. She then sends the funding amount and
funding transaction hash to Bob.

**4. Bob builds and signs a refund transaction, sends it to Alice.** Alice and
Bob go through the protocol described below for creating a payment, in the case
where Bob sends a payment to Alice. The payment spends all funds from the
funding transaction to Alice.

**5. Alice broadcasts the funding transaction.** When the refund transaction is
created and distributed between the two parties, Alice broadcasts the funding
transaction. The channel is open when the funding transaction is confirmed into
the blockchain.

At the end of the channel opening process, both agents store the following
information:

- three addresses (source, destination, multisig)
- a list of commitment transactions objects. The list has one entry that
  contains the secrets used for the first payment
- the public information about the other client; this also contains a list of
  commitment transaction objects with one entry containing the public
  projections (hahes) of two secrets.

### Creating the payment (asyncSend)

We describe a payment from Alice to Bob. Note that if this is not the first
payment, Alice has the hash of Bob's last revocation secret, and the hash of
Bob's last HTLC secret. If this is the first payment, revoking isn't necessary
and these secrets are not needed.

**1. Alice builds a commitment transaction for Bob, stores it, and asks him to
do the same (asyncSend).** Alice builds the transaction labeled "known only to
Bob" above. She then asks Bob to build one for her.<!--She uses the public
versions of the secrets obtained from Bob in step 2 and her own secrets
generated in Step 1. She signs the transaction and sends it to Bob.-->

**2. Bob builds a commitment transaction for Alice, stores it, and sends it to
Alice (asyncSend).**

**3. Alice checks the new commitment transaction, stores it, and sends the
transaction built in step 1 to Bob (asyncSendTxb).**

**4. Bob checks the new commitment transaction, stores it, and revokes the old
commitment transaction (asyncSendTxb).**

**5. Alice checks the revocation secret, stores it, generates new secrets, and
revokes the old commitment transaction (asyncPrepareNextPayment).**

**6. Bob checks the revocation secret, stores it, generates new secrets for the
next payment.**

<!--
**4. Alice checks the transaction, builds one for Alice and sends it to her.**
Bob checks that the transaction spends from the shared multisig address, spends
to his destination address, that the secrets used are the ones he generated in
Step 2, and that the spending amounts are as expected. If the test passes, he
builds the transaction labelled "known only to Alice" and sends it to her (this
is symmetric to case 3.).

**5. Alice checks the transaction obtained from Bob, and revokes her last
payment if the check passes.** To revoke the previous payment, Alice sends her
revocation secret from the last commitment transaction to Bob.

**6. Bob revokes.** Symmetrically, Bob sends Alice his revocation secret from
the last commitment transaction.

**1. Alice generates new secrets and sends them to Bob.** She locally creates a
revocation secret and a htlc secret for use on the next transaction. She then
sends the public versions (hashes) of these secrets to Bob.

**2. Bob generates a new secrets and sends them to Alice.** This is symmetric
to the case above
-->
### Closing the channel

Either party can broadcast their most recent commitment transaction to the
blockchain. In this case both parties go through the following protocol

**1. Find the most recent HTLC secret.**

**2. Build a spending transaction.**

**3. Broadcast spending transaction and the most recent commitment
transaction.**

The party that broadcasts the commitment transaction must wait for a day to do
that, the other party can do so as soon as possible.

### Enforcing the HTLC

In case one party fails to spend an output by providing the HTLC secret, the
other party can spend the HTLC output after 2 days.

**1. Build spending transaction using spending key.**

**3. Broadcast spending transaction and the most recent commitment
transaction.**

### React to other agent broadcasting an old commitment transaction

In that case one party broadcasts an old commitment transaction,
the other party goes trough the following:

**1. Find the corresponding HTLC secret.**

**2. Create an output script that spends the HTLC output.**

**3. Find the corresponding revocation secret.**

**4. Create an output script that spends the revocation output.**

**5. Build a transaction that spends both outputs.**

This has to happen within one day, in order to make sure that the revocation
output can be spent.
